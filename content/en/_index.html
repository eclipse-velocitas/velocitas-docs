  The Eclipse project Velocitas™ provides an end-to-end, scalable and modular development toolchain to create containerized in-vehicle applications (Vehicle Apps) 
  that offers a comfortable, fast and efficient development experience to increase the velocity of a development team.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-lightbulb" title="Vehicle App Project Template" url="https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-python-template" %}}
Quick setup of a _Vehicle App_ project with the help of GitHub templates for the supported programming languages including a sample _Vehicle App_ 
and GitHub Actions workflow, and comfortable setup of the development environment e.g. in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-code" title="Vehicle App Programming Model" url="docs/about/development_model/" %}}
Simplify coding and debugging of _Vehicle Apps_ that accessing vehicle data points and modifying vehicle functions 
using the provided SDK for the different programming languages that delegates to the _Vehicle Abstraction Layer_.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-layer-group" title="Vehicle Abstraction Layer" url="docs/about/development_model/val" %}}
Abstracts vehicle make & model specific properties and capabilities to a common representation. 
This makes it possible for _Vehicle Apps_ to be portable across different electric and electronic vehicle architectures 
e.g. the _Vehicle Apps_ do not care whether the seat is controlled via CAN, LIN or some other physical interface.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="GitHub Actions Workflow Blueprint" url="docs/about/deployment_model/vehicle_app_releases/" %}}
Providing ready-to-use GitHub workflows to check the _Vehicle App_, build images for multi architectures, scan it, 
execute integration tests and release the _Vehicle App_ to allow the developer to focus on the development of the _Vehicle App_.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="Automated Release Process" url="docs/about/deployment_model/vehicle_app_releases/" %}}
Providing a release workflow to generate release artifacts and documentation out of the CI workflow results and 
push it to the GitHub container registry to be used by a deployment system.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-box" title="Deployment Model" url="docs/about/deployment_model/" %}}
Running and deploying _Vehicle App_ as OCI-compliant container to increase the flexibility to support different programming languages 
and runtimes to accelerate innovation and development.
