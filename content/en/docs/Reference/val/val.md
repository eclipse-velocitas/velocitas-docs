## Introduction

The Vehicle Abstraction Layer (VAL) is a reference implementation of an abstraction layer that allows Vehicle applications
to interact with signals and services in the vehicle.
It currently consists of a data broker, a CAN feeder and a set of example services.
More elaborate or completely differing implementations are the target of particular derived projects.

## Architecture

The image below shows the main components of the Vehicle Abstraction Layer (VAL) and its relation to the [Velocitas Development Model](/docs/development-model.md).

### Vehicle Data Broker

The [Vehicle Data Broker](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_databroker) is a gRPC service acting as a broker of vehicle data / data points / signals.
It provides central access to vehicle data points arranged in a - preferably standardized - vehicle data model like the [COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/) or others.
It is implemented in Rust, can run in a container and provides services to get datapoints, update datapoints and for subscribing to datapoints.
Filter- and rule-based subscriptions of datapoints can be used to reduce the number of updates sent to the subscriber.

### Data Feeders

Conceptually, a data feeder is a provider of a certain set of data points to the data broker.
The source of the contents of the data points provided is specific to the respective feeder.

As of today, the Vehicle Abstraction Layer contains a [generic CAN feeder](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders) implemented in Python,
which reads data from a CAN bus based on specifications in a e.g., CAN network description file.
The feeder then uses a mapping file and data point metadata to convert the source data to data points and injects them into the Vehicle Data Broker using the Vehicle Data Broker gRPC interface.
The feeder automatically reconnects to the data broker in the event that the connection is lost.

### Vehicle Services

A vehicle service offers a gRPC interface for interacting with underlying services.
It can provide service interfaces to control actuators or to trigger (complex) actions, or provide interfaces to get data.
It communicates with the Hardware Abstraction to execute the underlying services, but may also interact with the Vehicle Data Broker.

As of today, the Vehicle Abstraction Layer contains one [example service to control a seat](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val.services/tree/v0.1.0/seat_service).
It is implemented in C++ and uses the [CAN feeder](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders) to control a seat in the vehicle.

### Hardware Abstraction

Data feeders rely on hardware abstraction. Hardware abstraction project/platform specific.
The reference implementation relies on [SocketCAN][(https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders)) and
[vxcan](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/tree/master/kuksa_feeders).
The hardware abstraction may offer replaying (e.g., CAN) data from a file (can dump file) when the respective data source (e.g., CAN) is not available.

## Information Flow

The vehicle abstraction layer offers an information flow between vehicle networks and vehicle services.
The data that can flow is ultimately limited to the data available through the Hardware Abstraction, which is platform/project-specific.
Which data can actually be sent or consumed is controlled by [DBC](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/master/kuksa_feeders/dbc2val/Model3CAN.dbc)
and [Mapping](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/master/kuksa_feeders/dbc2val/mapping.yml) files.
Services (like the [seat service](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val.services/tree/v0.1.0/seat_service)) define which CAN signals they listen to and which CAN signals they send themselves, see [documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val.services/blob/v0.1.0/seat_service/src/lib/seat_adjuster/seat_controller/README.md)
The Vehicle Data Broker offers read/write/subscribe using MQTT. The VSS signals supported are currently limited by a [hard coded list](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/master/kuksa_databroker/databroker/src/main.rs).

Additional information on how data privacy is managed can be found in the [Vehicle Abstraction Layer repository](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val.services/tree/v0.1.0#privacy-customer-information)
