- Vehicle API to abstract the vehicle's signals and E/E architecture helps to focus on business logic and enables _Vehicle Apps_ to be portable across different electric and electronic vehicle architectures
- Vehicle Apps skeleton and example Vehicle Apps helps to understand easily how to write a Vehicle Apps using the KUKSA VAL runtime services
- Higher development velocity through self-contained, containerized Apps with no dependencies to E/E architecture
