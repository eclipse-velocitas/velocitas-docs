# What offers Velocitas? 

- Predefined CI/CD workflows (in the form of GitHub Actions workflow) that build for multi architectures, test, document and deploy a Vehicle App helps saving setup time and focus on the development of the _Vehicle App_
- DevContainer helps to install everything to start the local development immediately in Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Vehicle API to abstract the vehicle's signals and E/E architecture for re-use and focus on business logic
- Vehicle Apps skeleton and example Vehicle Apps helps to understand easily how to write a Vehicle Apps using the KUKSA VAL runtime services
- Higher development velocity through self-contained, containerized Apps with no dependencies to E/E architecture

- Simplify coding and debugging of _Vehicle Apps_ that accessing vehicle data points and modifying vehicle functions 
using the provided SDK for the different programming languages that delegates to the _Vehicle Abstraction Layer_.
- Abstracts vehicle make & model specific properties and capabilities to a common representation. 
This enables _Vehicle Apps_ to be portable across different electric and electronic vehicle architectures 
e.g. not care whether the seat is controlled via CAN, LIN or some other physical interface.
