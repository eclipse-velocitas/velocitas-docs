_Velocitas_ provides examples based on use case of adjusting the vehicle seat position to showcase the development toolchain of a comfort function (QM level).

What could such a use case look like? Image a carsharing company that wants to offer its customers the functionality that the driver seat automatically moves to the right position, when the driver enters the rented car. The carsharing company knows the driver and has stored the preferred seat position of the driver in its driver profile. The car gets unlocked by the driver and a request for the preferred seat position of the driver will be sent to the vehicle.

That's where your implementation starts. A detailed description of the _Seat Adjuster_ use case can be found [here](use_cases/seat_adjuster/).
