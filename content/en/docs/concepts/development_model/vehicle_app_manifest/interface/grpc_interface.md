## Description

This interface type introduces a dependency to a gRPC service. It is used to generate either client stubs (in case your application requires the interface) or server stubs (in case your application provides the interface). The result of the generation is a language specific and package manager specific source code package, integrated with the Velocitas SDK core.

If a _Vehicle App_ requires a `grpc-interface` - a client stub embedded into the Velocitas framework will be generated and added as a build-time dependency of your application. It enables you to access your service from your _Vehicle App_ without any additional effort.

If a _Vehicle App_ provides a `grpc-interface` - a server stub embedded into the Velocitas framework will be generated and added as a build-time dependency of your application. It enables you to quickly add the business logic of your application.
