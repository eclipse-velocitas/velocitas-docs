## Interface type key: `grpc-interface`

## Description

This interface type introduces a dependency to a gRPC service. It is used to generate either client stubs (in case your application requires the interface) or server stubs (in case your application provides the interface). The result of the generation is a language specific and package manager specific source code package, integrated with the Velocitas SDK core.
