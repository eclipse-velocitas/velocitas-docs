Traditionally, the automotive industry was and still is centered around vehicle hardware and the corresponding hardware development and life-cycle management. Software, however, is gaining more and more importance in vehicle development and over the entire vehicle lifetime. Thus, the vehicle and its value to the customer is increasingly defined by software. This transition towards what are termed as software-defined vehicles changes the way in which we innovate, code, deliver and work together. It is a change across the whole mobility value chain and life-cycle: from development and production to delivery and operations of the vehicle.
