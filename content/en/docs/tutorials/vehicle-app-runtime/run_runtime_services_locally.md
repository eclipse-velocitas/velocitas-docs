## Using tasks in Visual Studio Code

**Overview:** If you are developing in Visual Studio Code, the runtime components (like _KUKSA Data Broker_ or _Vehicle Services_) are available for local execution as _Tasks_, a feature of the Visual Studio Code. Additional information on tasks can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).

**Quick Start:** Each component has a task that is defined in _.vscode/tasks.json_:

* Dapr (```Local - Ensure Dapr```): installs Dapr CLI and initializes Dapr if required
* Mosquitto (```Local - Mosquitto```): runs _Mosquitto_ as a container (```docker run```)
* KUKSA Data Broker (```Local - VehicleDataBroker```): downloads and runs _KUKSA Data Broker_
* (Optional) Seat Service (```Local - SeatService```): downloads and runs _Seat Service_, an example `Vehicle Service`
* (Optional) Feeder Can (```Local - FeederCan```): downloads and runs _FeederCAN_

**Run as Bundle:** To orchestrate these tasks, a task called `Start Vehicle App runtime` is available. This task runs the other tasks in the correct order. You can run this task by clicking `F1` and choose `Tasks: Run task`, then select `Start Vehicle App runtime`.

**Tasks Management:** Visual Studio Code offers various other commands concerning tasks like Start/Terminate/Restart/... You can access them by pressing F1 and typing `task`. A list with available task commands will appear.

**Logging:** Running tasks appear in the Terminals View of Visual Studio Code. From there, you can see the logs of each running task.

**Scripting:** The tasks itself are executing scripts that are located in `.vscode/scripts`. These scripts download the specified version of the runtime components and execute them along with Dapr. The same mechanism can be used to register additional services or prerequisites by adding new task definitions in the `tasks.json` file.

## Change version of runtime services

The version for the runtime services is defined in the file [`./prerequisite_settings.json`](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-python-template/blob/main/prerequisite_settings.json). If you want to update the version, change it within the file and re-run the runtime services by restarting the tasks or the script.

## Using KUKSA Data Broker CLI

A CLI tool is provided for the interact with a running instance of the KUKSA Data Broker. It can be started by running the task `Local - VehicleDataBroker CLI`(by pressing _F1_, type _Run Task_ followed by `Local - VehicleDataBroker CLI`). The _KUKSA Data Broker_ needs to be running for you to be able to use the tool.

## Integrating a new service into Visual Studio Code Task

Integration of a new service can be done by duplicating one of the existing tasks.

- Create a new script based on template script `.vscode/scripts/run-vehicledatabroker.sh`
- In `.vscode/tasks.json`, duplicate section from task `run-vehicledatabroker`
- Correct names in a new code block
- **Disclaimer:** `Problem Matcher` defined in `tasks.json` is a feature of the Visual Studio Code Task, to ensure that the process runs in background
- Run task using `[F1 -> Tasks: Run Task -> <Your new task name>]`
- Task should be visible in Terminal section of Visual Studio Code

### Task CodeBlock helper

```c
{
    "label": "<__CHANGEIT: Task name__>",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "./.vscode/scripts/<__CHANGEIT: Script Name.sh__> --task",
    "group": "none",
    "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "dedicated"
    },
    "isBackground": true,
    "problemMatcher": {
        "pattern": [
            {
                "regexp": ".",
                "file": 1,
                "location": 2,
                "message": 3
            }
        ],
        "background": {
            "activeOnStart": true,
            "beginsPattern": "^<__CHANGEIT: Regex log from your app, decision to send process in background__>",
            "endsPattern": "."
        }
    }
},
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem description:** When integrating new services into an existing dev environment, it is highly recommended to use the Visual Studio Code Task Feature.
A new service can be easily started by calling it from bash script, however restarting the same service might lead to port conflicts (GRPC Port or APP port). That can be easily avoided by using the Visual Studio Code Task Feature.

### Codespaces

If you are using Codespaces, remember that you are working on a remote agent. That's why it could happen that the tasks are already running in the background. If that's the case a new start of the tasks will fail, since the ports are already in use. In the Dapr-tab of the sidebar you can check if there are already tasks running. Another possibility to check if the processes are already running, is to check which ports are already open. Check the Ports-tab to view all open ports (if not already open, hit `F1` and enter `View: Toggle Ports`).
