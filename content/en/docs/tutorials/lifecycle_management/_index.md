## Background

Throughout our self maintained repositories e.g. [Python SDK](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-python-sdk) and [Python Template](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-python-template) we are using different shared configurations for various components/packages. Those are for example a collection for different [runtimes](/docs/tutorials/vehicle-app-runtime/) or settings for the use of [devcontainers](/docs/tutorials/quickstart/#visual-studio-code).
</br>
In order to have less maintenance effort for us, as well as give the opportunity to you as a user to update to new introduced bugfixes or features we introduced our Velocitas Lifecycle Management
